Laravel Project - Smart Jogja is a web-based project aimed at collecting and analyzing user evaluations of Trans Jogja transportation services. The website features two main roles: admin and user. Users, who are the passengers of Trans Jogja, can provide their assessments and feedback through surveys available on the website. These surveys cover various aspects of the transportation service, allowing users to share their experiences and suggestions for improvement. The admin role is responsible for managing and analyzing the collected data, generating reports, and making informed decisions to enhance the quality of Trans Jogja services. The goal of Smart Jogja is to create a reliable platform for passengers to voice their opinions and for administrators to improve the public transportation system based on user feedback.
